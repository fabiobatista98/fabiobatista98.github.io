				<h4>Full Stack Developer | Research Exchange | Security Developer | Pentester</h4>
				<br>
				<p>As a Full Stack Developer at SmartSIGN S2X Research Exchange, I spearheaded the development of a
					sophisticated
					web application at managing intelligent Road Signs and Roadside Units (RSUs) by leveraging the
					Google Maps API.
					This initiative aligned with the objectives of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS).<br>
					Furthermore, this project served as an integral part of my master's thesis, wherein comprehensive
					studies were
					conducted on security frameworks and methodologies for penetration testing. Drawing upon these
					insights, an
					application protection plan was devised, adhering to OWASP TOP 10 standards. Subsequently, a
					rigorous penetration
					testing phase was executed following the PTES methodology and the OWASP WSTG checklist to ensure
					robust security
					measures. <br>
					This experience underscores my proficiency in developing complex web applications, my adeptness with
					a diverse
					range of technologies, and my commitment to upholding stringent security standards in software
					development.<br>
					Key accomplishments of this endeavor include:

				<ul class="myFeatures">
					<li>
						<p>I deployed a web application named "Application Web Smart Sign," developed using PHP with the
							Laravel framework

							road signs and Roadside
							Units (RSUs) for placement in various locations. Leveraging the Google Maps API, users can
							efficiently interact
							with geographical data.<br><br>
							Following deployment, I implemented robust security mechanisms, drawing upon the OWASP Top
							10 guidelines. This
							included the integration of two-factor authentication (2FA) via mobile app or email,
							password reset functionality,
							protection against brute force attacks, input validation, and comprehensive logging of user
							authentication
							activities and user management operations.<br><br>
							Subsequently, I conducted a thorough penetration test using the PTES methodology and OWASP
							checklist
							with a grey-box approach. This involved simulating real-world attack scenarios to identify
							and address
							vulnerabilities within the application. Through this process, several vulnerabilities were
							uncovered and
							promptly remediated, ensuring the application's resilience against potential cyber threats.

				<h3><b>Some projects developed during the master's degree</b> - [ 09/2021 - 06/2022 ] - Leiria</h3>
				<ul class="myFeatures">
					<li>
						<h4><b>Configuration of Security Extensions in Database Services</b></h4>
						<p>This project describes the installation, configuration, and testing of security-related
							extensions in two distinct database services: MySQL and MongoDB. After a description and
							testing of the various extensions used in the services, comparisons between the two
							applications in the context of security will be presented.<br>
							This analysis aims to understand how advanced database services are regarding security,
							seeking authentication and auditing configurations, as well as configurations for encrypting
							content and communications.</p>
						<h4><b>Comparative Study: Analysis of SIEM Systems</b></h4>
						<p>I conducted a comparative analysis of four essential cybersecurity tools: Splunk Free, OSSIM,
							Securonix, and ELK Stack. This analysis is crucial as these tools play a vital role in
							safeguarding organizations against cyber threats. By evaluating their features,
							capabilities,
							and suitability for different organizational needs, I provided valuable insights into the
							strengths and weaknesses of each tool.</p>
						<h4><b>Analysis of a SIEM System: Elastic Stack</b></h4>
						<p>This project involved the implementation of a SIEM solution using the Elastic Stack. Multiple
							tests were conducted to showcase its significance in enhancing cybersecurity measures.
							Additionally, a comprehensive analysis was performed using RapidMiner software and Microsoft
							PowerBI, providing deeper insights into the effectiveness and functionality of the
							implemented
							solution. This project not only demonstrates hands-on experience with SIEM technologies but
							also highlights proficiency in data analysis and visualization tools.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4><b>Digital Forensic Analysis of the Withings Health Mate App</b></h4>

							store data without encryption. This highlights the need for improved security practices in
							application development.</p>
						<h4><b>Performing a pentest on a real target</b></h4>
						<p>Conducted a comprehensive pentest assessment focusing on network configurations and website
							vulnerabilities. Employed onsite testing procedures with strict adherence to confidentiality
							agreements. Identified and documented vulnerabilities in wireless networks, device
							enumeration, and website security. Provided actionable recommendations to enhance organizational
							 security measures. Collaborated effectively with stakeholders to ensure project objectives were met.
						</p>
						<h4><b>Kubernetes: Installation and configuration</b></h4>
						<p>This project describes the installation and configuration of the Kubernetes container
							orchestration system. This configuration is oriented towards administration and security,
							addressing topics such as clustering, container management, logging, auditing, and
