								To Whom It May Concern,
								<br>
								<br>
								I am writing to express my passion and dedication to pursuing a career in 
								cybersecurity. As a Portuguese national who recently relocated to Stuttgart, 
								Germany, I am excited about the opportunities this vibrant city has to offer 
								and eager to contribute my skills and expertise to the cybersecurity industry.
								<br>
								<br>
								In April 2024, me and my girlfriend came to germany, who 
								is a nurse working in a local hospital. Since then, we have been actively 
								integrating into the community and immersing ourselves in the German language 
								and culture. While my girlfriend has already achieved a B1 level in German, I 
								am committed to furthering my language skills and exploring opportunities to 
								contribute to the German workforce.
								<br>
								<br>
								I hold a master's degree in cybersecurity and computer forensics, and I bring 
								with me valuable experience gained from working in the IT cybersecurity team 
								of a major telecommunications company in Portugal. In this role, I had the 
								opportunity to hone my skills in various aspects of cybersecurity, further 
								fueling my passion for the field.
								<br>
								<br>
								My primary objective now is to leverage my expertise and experience to secure 
								a position in the cybersecurity industry in Germany. I am particularly drawn 
								to roles where I can apply my knowledge and contribute to protecting organizations 
								from cyber threats. I am enthusiastic about the prospect of joining a dynamic 
								team and making a meaningful impact in the cybersecurity landscape.
								<br>
								<br>
								While my immediate focus is on mastering the German language, I am also keen to 
								find opportunities where I can utilize my proficiency in English. I am confident 
								that my technical skills, combined with my determination and adaptability, make 
								me a valuable asset to any organization operating in the cybersecurity sector.
								<br>
								<br>
								Warm regards,
								<br>
								Fábio Baptista
